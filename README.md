# Chess Stats
Enter a [chess.com](https://chess.com) username and it will show you statistics of your Blitz, Rapid, Bullet and Daily games. It also shows a overview of profile like name, country, Profile picture and league. 

# How to use
It is hosted on netlify. [Here is the link](https://chess-stats-46.netlify.app/). Just visit the link, enter username and you get the stats. 

## Future work
There is much work to do on this project. I will keep updating this as I keep adding more and more features.
